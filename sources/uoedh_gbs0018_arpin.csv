"EDWARD ARPIN OF FELMERSHAM, 1763-1831"
Edited by C. D. Linnell
Introduction
"About thirty years ago Mrs. Marshall, of Sherrington, was"
"dusting a large old book, when there fell out of it some yellowed"
papers covered with faded handwriting. These she brought to
"the notice of Mr. Robertson Scott, the Editor of The Country-"
"man, who soon realised that they were a diary, “intermittently"
"kept, but continuing over some seventeen years, from 1814 to"
"1831”. “The handwriting and orthography,” he wrote, “are"
"those of a person who seldom writes and never reads,” though"
"this is hardly correct, as the diarist evidently read the"
"Northampton Mercury. Soon afterwards, in 1929, he published"
extracts in four successive numbers of The Countryman under
the heading of “A Grave-Digger’s Diary : 1814-1831”. Some
"of the extracts were copied into the Beds. Times', but, so far as"
"we know, the Diary has never been published in its entirety. A"
few years ago Mr. Scott kindly deposited it in the County
Record Office (A.D. 1714) and he has consented to its publica-
tion here. In consequence of information supplied to him by
"interested readers, he readily acknowledged that the writer was"
"not merely a “grave-digger”, but the parish clerk of Felmer-"
"sham, Beds., from 1824 to 1834. He was certainly not very"
erudite; but obviously he was able to fulfil fairly satisfactorily
the ordinary duties of a parish clerk.
"Felmersham, a small village on the river Ouse, is about seven"
"miles north-west of Bedford. Its church, founded in the twelfth"
"century, is avowedly the finest village church in the county, and"
"at this time the living was in the gift of Trinity College, Cam-"
bridge. The name Orpin has been fairly common in north Bed-
"fordshire since the end of the seventeenth century, especially in"
Harrold. About the middle of the eighteenth century some mem-
bers of the family seem to have migrated to Felmersham and
"Pavenham, which then formed one parish; for Edward Arpin"
"(the name is also spelt Orpin), our diarist, was baptised at"
"Pavenham in 1756, the son of William and Elizabeth Arpin. In"
"1777, when living at Radwell in Felmersham, he married Rachel"
"Dawson of Stagsden, and their four children were baptised at"
130
ARPIN	131
Felmersham between 1778 and 1787. Their names were
"William, Aga (?Hagar), Arabella and Abassinia."
Perhaps the most notable characteristic of the diary is its
objectivity. He never criticises the actions of the people he men-
"tions, but simply records facts. But he is wonderfully interested"
"in unusual phenomena, such as Hoods, droughts, storms, snow-"
"falls, and monstrosities. His notes about these can be read in the"
text; but many of them go to show that in Arpin’s day winter
"often began earlier and ended later than now. For instance, on"
"21 October 1819 it snowed, he says, for three hours. On 11 June"
1821 snow and hail fell to the depth of three inches in the
Northampton district. Professor Gordon Manley of London
"University, sometime President of the Royal Meteorological"
"Society, tells us that the frequent unseasonableness of the"
weather of 150 years ago is a recognised scientific fact.
The diary was written during a very critical period in
English history. The country was recovering but slowly after
twenty years of war following the French Revolution. The en-
"closure movement was still in full swing, causing discontent"
and unemployment among agricultural labourers. Prices were
"high, and the labour-market was overstocked, largely owing to"
the rapid increase of population. Thus employers were able
"to keep wages down to a mere subsistence level, which often"
had to be supplemented by allowances from the rates. In many
"villages emigration, sometimes paid for by a special rate,"
"helped to relieve the congestion; but from Felmersham, as"
"Arpin tells us, 39 people left for the U.S.A. in 1829 without,"
"apparently, greatly affecting the growth of population, which"
rose from 329 in 1801 to 448 in 1831. In any case the pre-
vailing poverty and wretchedness inevitably led to acts of
"violence and intimidation, and even murder."
"As a background to the diary, we have quite a quantity of"
contemporary literature bearing on the state of the country.
"The Rev. John Webster Hawksley, rector from 1792 to 1856"
"of Souldrop, a village only three miles distant from Felmer-"
"sham, wrote two pamphlets, in 1825 and 1833 respectively,"
showing that the village was still suffering from the effects of
"its enclosure, which had taken place as far back as 1770, and"
suggesting means of remedying them. He regards the new
class of “big” post-enclosure farmers as responsible for much
of the distress of the agricultural labourers. Indeed he accuses
"them of wasting their substance on the purchase of guns, wine,"
"and hunters, regardless of the welfare of their dependants. He"
132
ARPIN
tells us that on enclosure many cottagers lost their common-
"rights and privileges, which had enabled them to keep a few"
"sheep or a cow, and to get fuel. Large proprietors bought up"
"small freeholds, cottages, and common-rights, and attached"
them to their farms. The money received by the small owners
"soon dwindled to nothing, especially as they could not apply"
for relief till it was all spent. Thus they soon became landless
labourers. Hawksley points out that the “new” men soon dis-
covered that they could manage a much larger farm with the
same number of men and horses. Thus often two farms were
"laid into one, the consequence being that one tenant was turned"
"out, while his farm-house was pulled down or turned into"
"barns. This caused more unemployment, and the dispossessed"
farmer became a day-labourer. The rate of wages was deplor-
able. Men earned only 9s. a week. The only meat they and
their families could afford to buy was “occasional pork”. After
"they had bought bread and fuel, and paid their rent, what, he"
"pertinently asks, was left for clothes, boots, cheese, candles and"
sugar? Could farmers be surprised if their game-preserves
"were invaded, the taverns crowded, and the village lads be-"
"came “corrupted and debauched”, often ending in gaol?"
Hawksley has practical remedies in mind. He suggests
the division of some of the large farms into small holdings
"financed by a parish fund, and he says that he has already"
begun to set an example by letting off plots of arable and
meadow from his glebe for the benefit of his poorer parish-
"ioners. Judging by the diary, conditions at Felmersham must"
"have been very similar, though neither the clergymen nor"
Trinity College seems to have possessed the large-hearted im-
agination of Hawksley.
A pamphlet published in 1830 by Thomas Potter Mac-
"Queen, entitled “Thoughts and Suggestions on the Present"
"Constitution of the Country”, amply confirms Hawksley’s con-"
"clusions. MacQueen had been M.P. for Bedford, and Chair-"
man of a Parliamentary Poor Law Committee.
He gives various reasons for the degradation of the poor.
"Owing to the high price of food, farmers, he thought, had be-"
come “luxurious”. Labourers who had “lived in” were driven
"out, and married prematurely. Married men were entitled to"
"more parish relief than single ones, and this enabled farmers"
"to pay lower wages, partly at their neighbours’ expense. Thus"
"large occupiers prospered, while small yeomen died out. The"
"poor, demoralised by constantly applying for relief, looked on"
ARPIN	133
the overseer as a distributor of goods to which they had a
vested right. One result of this demoralisation was the
“enormously augmented number of natural children”. These
"must be supported by the parish, and thereby the rates were"
"forced up. Crime increased, for a poor fellow whose children"
cried for food was almost compelled to break the law.
These facts led MacQueen to criticise the criminal law
of his time. The number of crimes punishable by death was
"233, the result being that a large proportion of capital"
"sentences were never carried out. For instance, out of 553"
criminals condemned to death in 1815 only 57 (about 1 in 10)
"were executed. Between 1821 and 1827, out of 998 burglars"
"sentenced, only 7 were sent to the scaffold. This, he remarks,"
encouraged crime. Arpin mentions several instances of lawless-
ness which resulted in capital sentences. Practically all of these
were commuted to transportation. The remedy for this state
"of affairs proposed by MacQueen was emigration to Australia,"
on the ground that in that continent convicts by their own
efforts could become independent citizens and an asset to the
"Empire. He did not recommend emigration to America, though"
we find Felmersham people settling in the United States and
the West Indies.
"The petition, presented to the House of Commons in"
1829 by the Marquess of Tavistock on behalf of the magi-
"strates. farmers, overseers and labouring poor of Redbourn-"
"stoke Hundred confirms, if confirmation were needed, the"
contentions of Hawksley and MacQueen.
According to the petition the lace and straw-plaiting
"trades were in a very depressed condition, while the population"
was too large for all to find work. The farmers refused to
employ their proper proportion of labourers and threw the
burden of their maintenance on the overseers. During the past
"ten years £15,714 had been spent in relief, and in consequence"
the overseers had had to employ large gangs on the roads.
"The sum of £4,558 per annum had been spent on this unprofit-"
"able work, of which nine-tenths had been wasted. The peti-"
tioners considered that the paupers could be distributed among
"the farms, where they would do profitable work. In this way"
the enormous sums could be made to yield some return without
injuring the farmers or degrading the “small” husbandman to
pauperism. To this end they requested that legal action might
"be taken, for they regarded the evil moral effects of the pre-"
vailing system as more important than any pecuniary loss it
134
ARPIN
"entailed, adding that many men refused to work at all, prefer-"
ring a bare subsistence on half the current wages to hard work
on full pay. The employment of large and useless gangs pro-
duced an atmosphere of discontent which led in time to poach-
"ing on a large scale, tree-felling, sheep-stealing, and highway-"
robbery. Intimidation made detection of crime well-nigh
"impossible, and in some places it had been necessary to appoint"
night-watchers. Arpin describes the same state of affairs exist-
ing at Felmersham.
Extracts made by Mr. A. F. Cirket of the Record Office
from the Quarter Sessions Rolls for the years 1819-1836 com-
plete the background of our Diary. In 1819 four Marston
men were sentenced to fourteen days’ imprisonment for refus-
ing to work for the current wages. In 1821 three Milton
Ernest and three Oakley men suffered six weeks’ imprisonment
for a riot at Milton in which the parish constable and his
assistants were roughly handled. These comparatively unim-
portant incidents foreshadow the lawlessness of the “twenties”
and especially the “thirties”. The records of this period tell
of outrages and disorders against which authority was almost
powerless. Both men and women were prosecuted for intimida-
"tion, damaging parish property, rioting by as many as 100"
"people, assaults on overseers, parish constables, and even High"
"Constables of Hundreds, rick-burning, damaging fences, re-"
"fusing to work in work-houses, sheep-stealing, and highway"
robbery.
"At last authority became thoroughly alarmed, and the"
Minister of State in a circular letter of 1830 exhorted magi-
"strates to act with “promptitude, decision, and resolution”."
"Most of the trouble occurred in mid-Bedfordshire, especially"
at Ampthill and Stotfold. In the Ampthill area in 1835 there
were assaults on the new relieving officers and the guardians.
To restore order a body of Metropolitan policemen were sent
"down from London, four troops of yeomanry were called out,"
and more than 150 special constables enlisted.
The Felmersham of Arpin’s day seems to have been no
"better or worse than most north Bedfordshire villages, though"
violence was very common.
"Arpin’s text consists of irregular jottings, out of chrono-"
"logical order. For convenience, chronology has been restored"
in this publication.
